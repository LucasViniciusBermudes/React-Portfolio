    "description": "I’m a dedicated and curious front-end developer, passionate about building modern, functional, and well-structured interfaces. I mainly work with technologies like React, Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript, and SCSS, always aiming to deliver pleasant and intuitive user experiences. My journey started with a desire to understand how websites were made, and since then, I’ve been diving deeper into this universe. Currently, I’m expanding my skills into the back-end, learning technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL to become a more well-rounded developer. I enjoy working in teams, sharing knowledge, and tackling challenges that help me grow. Outside of coding, I like exploring new tools, learning new things, and keeping my projects moving forward."
